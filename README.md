# Secure Banking App

In this project, we have created a flask banking application. The main focus on this project was creatinng a secure web application. 
We have used Flask Web Framework for Python to help us avoid the three most common web attacks which are Cross-Site Scripting(XSS), SQL Injection,
and Cross-site request forgery(CSRF).
